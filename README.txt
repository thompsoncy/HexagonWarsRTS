This is my C++ final project for my CS 4150/5150: Game Artificial Intelligence class taken in Spring 2021.
My starting code base is from a knock off version of ClashRoyal called ClashLoyal and I turned it into a Hexagon command and conquer rts. 

The “Final Project Code” folder contains all code for my game(this code base was transferred here from my University provided github). 

The “Original Code” folder holds the starting code. 

The “Game” zip contains the game executable that is able to be run immediately. 

The final grade I received for this project was a 95/100
